A simple HTTP server.

## History
This very simple and basic HTTP server was created as an exercise in one of its creator's classes, in 2014.

Although it does serve statical pages, the usage of this server is discouraged as it was created solely for educational purposes. If you are a student, though, feel free to use and study it at your own will.
