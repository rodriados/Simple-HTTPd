# μHTTPd Webserver
![license MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)
![version 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.0-green.svg)

A very very simple and very very small HTTP server.

## Installation
μHTTPd requires very little work to start working, and cannot be configured in any manner! Just download the source
code, compile using `make` and run using `./bin/mu-httpd [port]`.

We dare you to find any other webserver as easy to use and featureless as ours.

## Features
μHTTPd can process many GET or POST static requests concurrently. Allows directory browsing, permanent redirect,
logs all access with no security check, overhead or any cool feature at all!

## Disclaimer
This very simple and basic HTTP server was created as an in-class exercise in one of its creators' courses, in 2014.

Although it does serve static pages, the usage of this server is discouraged as it was created solely for educational purposes. If you are a student, though, feel free to use, study and improve it at your own will.
